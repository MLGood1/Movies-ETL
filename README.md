# Movies-ETL

## Overview

Amazing Prime is interested in finding out which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the movies at a low price.  Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon providing a clean dataset to participants to predict the popular movies. Britta has been tasked with creating the clean data for the hackathon from two data sources, Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 and ratings data from MovieLens.  Britta and I are tasked with extracting the data from the two data sources, transforming it into one dataset, and then loading it into a SQL database.
